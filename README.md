# Matlab code, R shiny apps and data sets  included in the manuscript "Dynamic mixed data analysis and visualization"
This repository contains the matlab code, the R shiny apps and the data sets included in the "Dynamic mixed data analysis and visualization" paper submitted to Entropy.

The project is about constructing distance matrices for EU countries given some Covid-19 related variables.

The matlab part is about sections 2.1-2.4 and 3.1-3.2 of the manuscript, whereas the shiny apps are described in section 3.3.

The data sets contain the original data with the mixed-type variables about Covid-19 cases, vaccines and stringency measures distances for EU countries (except for Luxembourg and Cyprus).

To install the apps do the following steps. After downloading the R app files and all the distance datasets in the same folder, launch the apps from within R and choose the directory where you downloaded the files. Then, according to each app you choose to launch, choose different couples of countries for evaluating the time series of the distance between the two chosen countries, choose a single country to be compared to all other countries for app 2. For app 3 and also for the other two apps, there is a slider for temporal comparison and animation.
