# Matlab code and R shiny apps included in the manuscript "Dynamic mixed data analysis and visualization"
This repository contains the three apps included in the "Dynamic mixed data analysis and visualization" paper submitted to Entropy.

The project is about constructing distance matrices for EU countries given some Covid-19 related variables.

It contains the dataset containing the distances and the source code developed for displaying country comparison in terms of similarity with respect to these variables and according to what proposed in the manuscript.

After downloading the R app file and all the distance datasets in the same folder, launch the apps from within R and choose the directory where you downloaded the files. Then, according to each app you choose to launch, choose different couples of countries for evaluating the time series of the distance between the two chosen countrieschoose the single country to be compared to all other countries for app 2. For app 3 and also for the other two apps, therre is a slider for temporal comparison and animation.
